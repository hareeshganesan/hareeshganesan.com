title:  "Price matters"
---

- Online grocery hasn't penetrated widely because consumers still value price, and e-grocery offers just aren't competitive.
    - Enduring retail businesses like Walmart and Costco have focused on offering lower, more competitive prices, to the exclusion of all else.
    - Technology businesses like Amazon focused on convenience, but ultimately often cost more. Having competitive prices has been important, but much of that benefit came from enabling international 3P sellers. 
    - The latest spate of tech retail has focused mostly on convenience, however, but consumers still expect high quality prices and aren't getting them. 

- Parents are constantly giving each other updates on grocery lists, what people ate, upcoming events.
- Parent communities have tons of listings and recommendations and drive a large amount of business. Many of these communities have become digital Whatsapp chats.
- As a parent, I'd love to just place orders for the things I need and have them show up, but I have to remember to do it, and I always seem to be in stock when I set my calendar reminders.
- People often solve this with a weekly or monthly bulk "haul" and then several top-ups throughout the week or month.
