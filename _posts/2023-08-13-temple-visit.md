I visited a Sivan temple with Naomi today. I really liked it, and I was trying to explain why I liked it. I liked my description so I’m including it here.

Hindu temples are rooted in physicality. The memories I have of them are of textures, smells, and sounds. Warm stone, cool marble, the smell of kumkumam, vibuthi, and velakku, the sounds of the mani during a puja. These sensations rush back each time I go, and they’re what make the experience significant. 

I’d venture that for many Hindus, the temple has to have a certain physical presence to be a good temple. It doesn’t need to be ornate- a room with an idol is enough. But a temple without the physics doesn’t inspire those feelings of holy peace that we often seek out. 

I think this is partially because none of us have a clue what’s being said! There are no sermons. There aren’t even specific timings to attend. The services are in an ancient language that very few have studied, and the prayers performed in the temple don’t include parables to learn from or analyze. 

This is not the way many other religions work - Bible studies and weekly services at Synagogue often have at least some portion held in native languages taught in lucid ways. There are rarely idols or stations to focus on the physical. I don’t really know what resonates with other religious people but at least based on what I’ve experienced, it’s not nearly as sensory. 

But I think the reliance on the physical, versus the reasonable, is a feature, not a bug. Visiting temples with religious intent forces you to grapple with things that are unknowable but present - because that’s all there is to hold onto. When I attend, I find myself alone, engaged in a dialogue and a language of my choice, walking around various shrines, with the God in front of me. While this sort of dialogue happens in many religious places, what’s interesting is that it seems like the Hindu practice relies entirely on physicality and private quiet to work.

I realize, writing this out, that the Hinduism I experienced was felt, not explained, and not taught. Temples rooted in the physical, home practices rooted in the emotional. Maybe ironic for a religion that often teaches detachment from worldly matters, but still wholly a human and comforting experience to be cherished.
