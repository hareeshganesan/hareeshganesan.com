## Research

## Observations
- The home is not the consumer, the restaurant is. And the consumer orders delivery? Seems strange that everything is so so focused on delivery. This could be a bias that I have that is absolutely not true.
- I wonder how personal chefs feel about the facilities they work in. Do they use new equipment? Like flash ovens, freezers, etc. Is there a process to be delivered there?
- Automation -> lower labor costs + new ways of reaching consumers fast.
- "Roughly two-thirds of homes today have at least one air fryer, according to data analytics firm Circana, up sharply from 2021. Two years ago, the appliance became the fourth most popular cooking device behind the stove top, microwave and oven" -> faster reheat, easier to get the textures that people want.

## Questions
- What will change about distribution? Has it become infinite? What are the problems brands face?
- How do **companies build value** in the food space.

- Reducing labor is still the primary focus. But at the store level, it creates value because you have actions that are repeated frequently. If the quality is good enough it is not a big deal.


One of the coolest things I saw this year was Hestia Kitchen’s end-to-end automated multicooker that powers fast casual restaurants like Nice Day in Brooklyn as well as Michelin-recommended establishments like Café Hunan in Hong Kong
    "at the push of a button, reducing kitchen labor by as much as 66%"
    "marshaling ingredients from the fridge to the dispenser, adding each ingredient to the wok based on its required cook time before automatically plating the dish"
    "The system even magically cleans itself in-between uses. Hestia leases the machines for $6k per month to operators, which includes services like maintenance and recipe design"


Bear is an automated delivery device 
    "Strengthen your workforce with AI-powered delivery robots"
    CloudKitchens is one of the largest customers of Bear’s standard product, which runs ~$600 per month and has been replacing runners at brick and mortar restaurants as well as ghost kitchens. The new room service robot will likely cost ~$1k per month.

Hyperspeed cooking
    UNOX’s booth featuring its Speed-X combi oven that does convection, microwave, and steam to reduce cook times by as much as 75%.
    Evereo “hot fridges” were also an integral part of the setup, allowing chefs to prep as much as up to three days in advance, hot-holding items in a multi-day vacuum seal or tray. The pitch for this kind of prep is driven by safety and convenience. Cook, chill, and reheat processes require food to pass through unsafe temperature zones three times. With Evereo, chefs can batch prep days in advance, holding proteins, grains, etc. at a stable temperature before finishing them in the Speed-X during service with a similar quality of scratch cooking. 

### [Lessons Learned From Grocery Automation Startup Takeoff Technologies’ Bankruptcy](https://www.hngry.tv/articles/grocery-automation-lessons-learned-from-takeoff-technologies-bankruptcy/)

Synthesis:
- I can't get a read on MFCs utility or not. Takeoff certainly didn't work for the premise of grocers to compete with Amazon.

* Late last week, grocery microfulfillment (MFC) startup Takeoff Technologies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing its inability to scale customer pilots beyond the three sites per customer required for profitability amidst macroeconomic headwinds
* the promise of MFC’s bolted on to grocers’ existing stores and some of the key learnings
* Does automation makes grocery pickers more productive?
    - According to a report from MWPVL, MFCs like Takeoff brought down labor costs of in-store pickers by 63% and manual-pick dark stores by 51%.
    - But in an automation report conducted by HNGRY for a long-short hedge fund, research showed that systems like Takeoff cost grocers ~$4-7mm all-in but ended up costing roughly the same percentage on a per order basis as Instacart’s merchant take rate when accounting for amortization of the equipment, licensing fees, and labor. 
* You can't just magically scale up to 20k SKUs. It gets a lot more complicated and tougher. And, the smaller the assortment you're automating, the easier it is to do manually,” said an interviewee from The Partnering Group in a E-Grocery Infrastructure 2023 report. “The bar for ROI goes up. If you're doing just 2-3k Q-Commerce style, that is almost impossible to automate cost effectively because it's so easy to do manually. You can pick super quickly from that tiny assortment, whereas once you go up to much bigger assortments, it gets much tougher to pick manually. But then the automation is incrementally more challenging.

* __Stores are getting smaller in the center - the fewer the SKUs the less the value of automation?__
    - I don’t believe that people really value the opportunity to walk up and down aisles and select their own packaged goods. I think that once customers understand that all they have to do is order what they want via a screen, at home or in-store, and let the robots pick it, that there won’t be many people that say ‘I’d rather pick my own box of cereal
