## Research

### Observations
- The home is not the consumer, the restaurant is. And the consumer orders delivery? Seems strange that everything is so so focused on delivery. This could be a bias that I have that is absolutely not true.
- I wonder how personal chefs feel about the facilities they work in. Do they use new equipment? Like flash ovens, freezers, etc. Is there a process to be delivered there?
- Automation -> lower labor costs + new ways of reaching consumers fast. If you can get the cost of a microfulfillment center cheap enough, it can replace a "full time shopper" -- often offered by Instacart. 
- We had a wave of startups that used human labor in order to complete certain tasks. We assumed at some point that automation would replace the commodity labor provided by those humans but it turns out that the cost of the machines continues to be higher than the cost of the humans - remember you have to __beat__ $15-20 / hour in order to make it worth it. 
- Food startups these days revolve around business model innovation with 3 partners: fulfillment, food, and consumers. You can decide to be more or less involved in each stage.
- Robot, not robot: When we talk about robots of the future, we're often talking about very general purpose task performing platforms of various shapes and sizes (e.g. Figure, or Tesla's Optimus). The robots that have succeeded thus far have been purpose built for specific applications  -- Kiva-style Roombas for the warehouse, or the mighty dishwasher. The automation in kitchens appears to be exclusively about the kitchen, where the jobs are indeed quite specific.

5. **Year 5:**
   - Total Cost: $175
   - Total Benefit: $7,300
   - Net Benefit: $7,125
   - Cumulative Net Benefit: $31,575

## Conclusion
Based on these assumptions, the home cooking robot would pay for itself in about 16.5 months. Over a 5-year period, it would provide a total net benefit of $31,575.

## ROI over 5 years
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs * 100
    = ($36,500 - $4,925) / $4,925 * 100
    = 641%

### Questions
- What will change about distribution? Has it become infinite? What are the problems brands face?
- How do **companies build value** in the food space?
- Does AI play any role at all?
- Has something significantly changed about robotics or consumer demand?
- How do you actually go about building a "proprietary" data set?

### Air fryers ###
**Air fryers are the most popular appliance to hit the kitchen in years**
>Roughly two-thirds of homes today have at least one air fryer, according to data analytics firm Circana, up sharply from 2021. Two years ago, the appliance became the fourth most popular cooking device behind the stove top, microwave and oven"

- Reducing labor is still the primary focus. But at the store level, it creates value because you have actions that are repeated frequently. If the quality is good enough it is not a big deal


>One of the coolest things I saw this year was Hestia Kitchen’s end-to-end automated multicooker that powers fast casual restaurants like Nice Day in Brooklyn as well as Michelin-recommended establishments like Café Hunan in Hong Kong

>at the push of a button, reducing kitchen labor by as much as 66%

>marshaling ingredients from the fridge to the dispenser, adding each ingredient to the wok based on its required cook time before automatically plating the dish

>The system even magically cleans itself in-between uses. Hestia leases the machines for $6k per month to operators, which includes services like maintenance and recipe design

**Bear is an automated delivery device**
> "Strengthen your workforce with AI-powered delivery robots"
CloudKitchens is one of the largest customers of Bear’s standard product, which runs ~$600 per month and has been replacing runners at brick and mortar restaurants as well as ghost kitchens. The new room service robot will likely cost ~$1k per month.

**Hyperspeed cooking**
> UNOX’s booth featuring its Speed-X combi oven that does convection, microwave, and steam to reduce cook times by as much as 75%.

Evereo “hot fridges” were also an integral part of the setup, allowing chefs to prep as much as up to three days in advance, hot-holding items in a multi-day vacuum seal or tray. The pitch for this kind of prep is driven by safety and convenience. Cook, chill, and reheat processes require food to pass through unsafe temperature zones three times. With Evereo, chefs can batch prep days in advance, holding proteins, grains, etc. at a stable temperature before finishing them in the Speed-X during service with a similar quality of scratch cooking.

### [Lessons Learned From Grocery Automation Startup Takeoff Technologies’ Bankruptcy](https://www.hngry.tv/articles/grocery-automation-lessons-learned-from-takeoff-technologies-bankruptcy/)

Synthesis:
- MFCs
- I can't get a read on MFCs utility or not. Takeoff certainly didn't work for the premise of grocers to compete with Amazon. But maybe it works for other types of grocery vendors.
- Stores are getting smaller in the center - the fewer the SKUs the less the value of automation?
- 


> Late last week, grocery microfulfillment (MFC) startup Takeoff Technologies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing its inability to scale customer pilots beyond the three sites per customer required for profitability amidst macroeconomic headwinds
the promise of MFC’s bolted on to grocers’ existing stores and some of the key learnings


> According to a report from MWPVL, MFCs like Takeoff brought down labor costs of in-store pickers by 63% and manual-pick dark stores by 51%. But in an automation report conducted by HNGRY for a long-short hedge fund, research showed that systems like Takeoff cost grocers ~$4-7mm all-in but ended up costing roughly the same percentage on a per order basis as Instacart’s merchant take rate when accounting for amortization of the equipment, licensing fees, and labor. 


> You can't just magically scale up to 20k SKUs. It gets a lot more complicated and tougher. And, the smaller the assortment you're automating, the easier it is to do manually,” said an interviewee from The Partnering Group in a E-Grocery Infrastructure 2023 report. “The bar for ROI goes up. If you're doing just 2-3k Q-Commerce style, that is almost impossible to automate cost effectively because it's so easy to do manually. You can pick super quickly from that tiny assortment, whereas once you go up to much bigger assortments, it gets much tougher to pick manually. But then the automation is incrementally more challenging.

>I don’t believe that people really value the opportunity to walk up and down aisles and select their own packaged goods. I think that once customers understand that all they have to do is order what they want via a screen, at home or in-store, and let the robots pick it, that there won’t be many people that say ‘I’d rather pick my own box of cereal

>"The tomato sauce comes from the automated warehouse and the fresh pasta and ground beef come from the corner store to form the most cost-effective dinner."

- Microfulfillment centers enable retailers to achieve fast delivery times for a small number of SKUs (< 10k)


> Conjoint analysis shows same day delivery most important factor, then price
> Ocado overly confident in nextday proposition, dismissing newer quick commerce players, simultaneously pitching investors on sameday "mini CFCs" (two of which it has sold itself, one to Kroger.)

### Embodied AI Eclipse

- The article is a bit handwavy, but it does highlight that the labor shortage may give way to high value placed onto solutions.


> The anticipation in the field isn’t just sparked by phenomenal technical strides — such as a 2,000-fold increase in computational power, plummeting costs of lidar sensors and other hardware, or the emergence of foundation models pioneering new ways of learning with increasing accuracy and robust safety controls. Nor is it because of the fast-growing ecosystem of developer tools empowering small teams to tackle complex tasks with human-like precision once infeasible. These technical leaps have to meet market-wide shifts to fully realize their potential. 

> The worker shortage will put a floor under how much the economy slows because job openings are going to remain far above the number of unemployed workers. Plus, wages have been growing smartly, and they are likely to continue to do so because the demand for workers outpaces their supply.
