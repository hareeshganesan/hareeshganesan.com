## Hi, I'm Hareesh. 

Right now, I'm a product manager at [Amazon Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.amazon.com/), helping build the world's most customer-centric pharmacy. 

Previously, I cofounded [Fellow](https://myfellow.com) (formerly TowerView Health), where I worked with amazing people building products and services for patients to manage medications. I started my career in strategy consulting at [Applied Predictive Technologies](https://www.predictivetechnologies.com/en), working with businesses set up and evaluate controlled experiments in sectors like retail, telecom, and banking.

For more details, here's my [resume](https://github.com/hareeshganesan/hareeshganesan.com/raw/master/assets/resume.pdf).

I'm interested in learning about:
- how to make healthcare better
- music and the Internet
- product management 
- operations

For fun, I write and perform music, and like to build side projects.
