## Hi, I'm Hareesh. 

I'm based in Philadelphia. I'm a co-founder at [TowerView Health](https://towerviewhealth.com) where I work with amazing people building products to help people with medications.

Before that, I spent some time in strategy consulting at [Applied Predictive Technologies](https://www.predictivetechnologies.com/en), helping businesses experiment and evaluate controlled tests in sectors like retail, telecom, and banking.

I've been interested in learning about:
- customer experiences in healthcare
- music and songwriting
- startup operations
