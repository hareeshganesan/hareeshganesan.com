## Hi, I'm Hareesh. 

I'm based in Philadelphia. I'm a co-founder at [Fellow](https://myfellow.com) (formerly TowerView Health) where I work with amazing people building products to help people with medications.

Before that, I spent some time in strategy consulting at [Applied Predictive Technologies](https://www.predictivetechnologies.com/en), helping businesses set up and evaluate controlled experiments in sectors like retail, telecom, and banking.

For more details, here's my [resume](https://github.com/hareeshganesan/hareeshganesan.com/raw/master/assets/resume.pdf).

I'm interested in learning about:
- customer experiences in healthcare
- product management 
- startup operations

For fun, I write and perform music, and like to build side projects.
