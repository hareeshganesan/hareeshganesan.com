## Hi, I'm Hareesh. 

I'm a product manager at [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk/), where I build technology to make sure people get their food delivered hot, on-time, and fast.

Before that, I helped launch [Amazon Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.amazon.com/), helping build the world's most customer-centric pharmacy, and also co-founded a hardware startup [Fellow](https://myfellow.com) (formerly TowerView Health) where I worked with amazing people on products to help patients to manage medications. I started my career in strategy consulting at [Applied Predictive Technologies](https://www.predictivetechnologies.com/en), helping businesses set up and evaluate controlled experiments in sectors like retail, telecom, and banking.

I'm interested in learning about:
- music and the Internet
- ops-centric businesses (atoms not bits)
- how to make healthcare better
- product management 

For fun, I write and perform music, and like to build side projects.
