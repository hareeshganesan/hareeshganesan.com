## Welcome

Hi, I'm Hareesh. I live in Philadelphia, by way of DC and NC. I'm a co-founder at [TowerView Health](https://towerviewhealth.com) where I work on technology to help people with medications.

Before that, I spent some time at [Applied Predictive Technologies](https://www.predictivetechnologies.com/en) working on strategic consulting for retailers, telecom, and banking.

I like talking about:
- pharmacy/healthcare
- music
- general technology

If you do too, shoot me a note at hi [at] hareeshganesan.com
